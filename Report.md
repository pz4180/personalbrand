## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to create a personal brand website using ASP.NET Web Forms. A personal brand website helps people show who they are and what they do to the world through the internet.

This website is about Nio Pei Zhi, a pastry chef who loves baking. The website shows her skills, her story, and the beautiful desserts she creates. Visitors can learn about her journey, see her work, and contact her for orders or questions.

The personal brand represents a creative and passionate pastry chef. The website uses bright colors and fun designs to show her happy and joyful personality. It helps people remember her and trust her baking skills.

## 2. Tools and Technologies Used

### ASP.NET Web Forms
ASP.NET Web Forms is a tool from Microsoft for building websites. I chose Web Forms because it is easy to learn and works well with Visual Studio. It uses a Master Page system, which means I can create one main template and use it on all pages. This saves time and keeps the website looking the same everywhere.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
HTML is used to create the structure of each page. It tells the browser what content to show, like text, images, and buttons.

CSS is used to make the website look beautiful. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, and animations. All the styles are in one file called Site.css, which makes it easy to change the look of the whole website.

JavaScript adds interactive features. For example, on the homepage, there is an image slider that automatically changes pictures. On the portfolio page, JavaScript makes the filter buttons work so users can sort items by category.

### Visual Studio
Visual Studio is the program I used to write and test the code. It is a powerful tool that helps find errors and preview the website before publishing.

## 3. Website Design Overview

### Color Scheme
The website uses a pastel color palette that feels warm and inviting. The main colors are:
- **Pink (#ff9eb5)** - Used for highlights and buttons
- **Yellow (#ffeb80)** - Used for accents and tags
- **Blue (#6cd3ff)** - Used for headings and skills
- **Green (#d1ff8e)** - Used for call-to-action buttons
- **Light Blue (#9bd7ff)** - Used for the footer background

These soft colors match the sweet and cheerful theme of a pastry chef.

### Font Choices
The website uses Segoe UI font. This font is clean, modern, and easy to read. It looks professional but also friendly, which fits the pastry chef brand.

### Layout Style
The layout is simple and organized. Each page has clear sections with enough space between them. The design uses cards, grids, and rounded corners to create a soft and modern look.

### How Design Reflects the Brand
The design shows the pastry chef's personality. The bright colors represent happiness and creativity. The smooth animations and playful icons make visitors feel welcomed. Everything on the website says "sweet" and "delicious," just like the pastries.

## 4. Page Descriptions

### Homepage
The homepage is the first page visitors see. It has two main parts. On the left side, there is a profile picture, the chef's name, and a tagline that says "Baking Happiness, One Pastry at a Time." On the right side, there is an image slider showing beautiful creations.

Below the hero section, there is a "What I Offer" section with four cards: Custom Cakes, Artisan Pastries, Fresh Breads, and Sweet Treats. Each card has an icon to make it easy to understand.

At the bottom, there is a call-to-action section with two buttons: "Learn More" and "Contact Me."

### About Me Page
The About Me page tells the chef's story. It explains how she started baking with her grandmother and became a professional pastry chef. There is also a Skills section showing her expertise: Cake Decorating, Sugar Art, French Pastry, and Menu Design. Each skill has an icon.

The Achievements section uses a vertical timeline design. It shows important moments like winning awards and getting certified. The baking action image is placed beside the story to make the page more interesting.

### Portfolio Page
The Portfolio page displays the chef's masterpieces. It has a filter system with four buttons: All, Cakes, Pastries, and Breads. When users click a button, only the matching items appear.

There are 18 items in total, organized in a grid layout. Each item has an image, a name, and a short description. The cards have a hover animation that lifts them up slightly.

### Contact Page
The Contact page allows visitors to send messages. It has a form with five fields: Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Subject, and Your Message. There is a friendly message at the top that says the chef would love to hear from visitors.

## 5. Navigation and User Experience

### How Users Move Between Pages
The navigation bar is at the top of every page. It has links to Home, About Me, Creations, and Contact. The logo "Nio Pei Zhi" is clickable and takes users back to the homepage.

The footer also has Quick Links for easy access to all pages. Social media icons let users visit Instagram, Facebook, or Gmail in a new tab.

### Why Navigation is Simple
The navigation is designed to be user-friendly. All links are visible and easy to find. Users do not need to search for information. The sticky navigation bar stays at the top when scrolling, so users can switch pages anytime.
